# Deep-Learning-Model-and-Training
python cod efor Assessment Specifications
In this assignment, you are expected to work individually on a given problem set and attempt to write Python code to address each given task. This assignment is particularly useful for getting started with Deep Learning model training and development.
The Iris Data Set (i.e., Problem Set)
The Iris data set is a popular data set for classification tasks in machine learning. It consists of 150 samples of iris plants, with each sample consisting of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target label indicating the species of the iris plant (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

To solve the assignment using the Iris data set, students would need to preprocess the data, develop and train a Deep Learning model, and evaluate the performance of the model. Preprocessing the data might involve scaling the features and splitting the data into training and validation sets. Developing and training the model could involve selecting an appropriate architecture and optimization algorithm, setting the learning rate, and choosing the number of epochs. Evaluating the performance of the model could involve using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's ability to classify the iris plants correctly.
Guidelines for Developing a Good Model
When planning on your model design, please remember that is always good practice to:

I. Select an appropriate architecture: Choose a model architecture that is suitable for the task at hand. For the Iris data set, a simple feedforward neural network with one or two hidden layers might be sufficient.

II. Choose appropriate activation functions: Select activation functions that are suitable for the task and the architecture of the model. For example, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function might be a good choice for the hidden layers of a feedforward neural network.

III. Implement the model correctly: Make sure to implement the model correctly in Python using a library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. This might involve defining the model architecture, compiling the model with an appropriate optimization algorithm and loss function, and training the model using the training data.

IV. Test the model with sample data: Before training the model on the full data set, it can be helpful to test the model with a small sample of the data to make sure it is working correctly. This can help to identify any issues with the implementation before investing a lot of time in training the model.

V. Document the model: Document the model architecture and the decisions made during the development process. This can help to provide context for the model's performance and make it easier to understand and reproduce the results.

Explanation of Code:

    Loading the Data:
        The Iris dataset is loaded directly from the UCI repository. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris plants with four features and a species label.

    Data Preprocessing:
        The species labels are mapped to integers (0 for Setosa, 1 for Versicolor, and 2 for Virginica).
        The features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure they have zero mean and unit variance.
        The dataset is split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets using train_test_split.
        The target variable (y) is one-hot encoded using to_categorical from Keras.

    Model Development:
        A feedforward neural network (FNN) with two hidden layers is built using Sequential from Keras.
        The first hidden layer has 64 neurons and uses the ReLU activation function.
        The second hidden layer (optional) has 32 neurons, also using ReLU.
        The output layer uses a softmax activation function since it's a multi-class classification task.

    Model Training:
        The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
        The model is trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 10, and validation is done on the validation set during training.

    Model Evaluation:
        The model is evaluated using accuracy and a detailed classification report that includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

    Reflection:
        The results are printed, and the model is saved as iris_model.h5 for future use.

Additional Notes:

    Dataset Source: The dataset is available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle. You can directly load the dataset using pandas.
    Hyperparameters: You can experiment with hyperparameters like the number of epochs, learning rate, and batch size for improved results.
    Model Performance: If the model doesn't perform well, consider using a different architecture, tuning the hyperparameters, or performing additional data preprocessing like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or feature engineering.

Deliverables:

    Code: The Python script implementing the solution.
    Report: A Word document with the following sections:
        Introduction: Briefly explain the Iris dataset and the purpose of the classification task.
        Data Preprocessing: Discuss the steps taken to preprocess the data.
        Model Design: Explain the architecture and choices made (e.g., activation functions, number of layers).
        Training and Evaluation: Discuss the model’s performance, metrics used (accuracy, precision, recall), and any challenges faced.
        Conclusion: Summarize the results and any possible improvements.

Conclusion:

This code provides a basic solution for solving the Iris classification problem using deep learning techniques. The next step would be to experiment with different architectures and optimizations to improve the model’s performance.
